Following the installation of osTicket, there are some things I configured to make it resemble an actual workplace HelpDesk. First I went ahead and created a new role named "Supreme Admin", and I gave it all permissions and tasks so it has all access.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Next I created a new Department called "SysAdmin". Creating departments ensures that tickets are routed efficiently, handled by the right people, and organized in a way that supports the businessâ€™s needs.

</p>
<p>
Next on the list I created a new team called "Online Banking", this is to route specific tickets relating to the software of an online banking app or website.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Then, inside user settings within the admin panel I had to check the box next to "require registration and login to create tickets". This is so we can create users, and logins for the users to simulate what it would look like to create a ticket from an employees POV.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
The next step was to create an Agent (someone to work the tickets), so from within the admin panel I created an agent named "Jane Doe". After creating Jane, I put her into the SysAdmins department to give her the same permissions that I gave SysAdmins earlier in the lab.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
After Jane Doe, I created another agent named "John Doe", but instead of putting him in the same department I put him into the "Supreme Admin" department with a support role. This way when I create tickets and send them to different departments, I can login to different agents and observe.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Now from the agent panel, I went to users > create, and I created users "Ken", and "Karen". These will be our employees so to speak. They will be able to create and send tickets.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
With tickets, there needs to be some sort of way to categorize them in regards to priority. In order to do this I created different SLA's (Service Level Agreement). This decides the order / time period the tickets need to be worked in. For example Sev-A would be the most important, Sev-B is below Sev-A, and Sev-C is the lowest level priority. This is usually determined by the importance to the company running / making money.. For instance, if a banks online banking went completely down, that would severely affect the business so it would be Sev-A. The next steps below will be examples of this.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
I then just needed to configure different help topics for the users to choose from. In this step I created a help topic named "business critical outage". Which if you remember, would be classified a Sev-A SLA, so after creating the topic I assigned it to Sev-A.
