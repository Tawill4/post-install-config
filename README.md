Following the installation of osTicket, there are some things I configured to make it resemble an actual workplace HelpDesk. First I went ahead and created a new role named "Supreme Admin", and I gave it all permissions and tasks so it has all access.

Next I created a new Department called "SysAdmin". Creating departments ensures that tickets are routed efficiently, handled by the right people, and organized in a way that supports the businessâ€™s needs.

Next on the list I created a new team called "Online Banking", this is to route specific tickets relating to the software of an online banking app or website. Similar help topics may get routed here as well.
